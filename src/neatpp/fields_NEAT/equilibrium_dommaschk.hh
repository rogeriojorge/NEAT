/* Stellarator equilibrium magnetic field using Dommaschk potentials, in cylindrical coordinates
    To initialize an equilibrium_dommaschk object such that it can be used, 
    a metric_cylindrical object must be provided, along with a magnetic field
    normalization B0. Additionally, these potentials are characterized by four values.
    They are: m and l, two integers that represent the number of toroidal and poloidal
    periods of the field. The other two numbers are coeff1 and coeff2, two doubles.
    If one is following the 1986 paper by W. Dommaschk, these values represent the following:
    when l is even, coeff1 and coeff2 correspond to b and c of equation (12),
    and if l is odd, then coeff1 and coeff2 correspond to a and d of equation (12).
    This simplification assumed the Stellarator symmetry V_{m,l}(R,\phi,Z) = -V_{m,l}(R,-\phi,-Z)

/*
Possible opimizations: not adding the 1/R and -1/RÂ² terms in each field to then subtract
them, instead just using the equilibrium_inverse_R_factor defined in dommaschktrace.hh to add
those terms once at the end
Also, there is currently no parallel computing
